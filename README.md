# StoreExample

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0.

This is my attempt at following [the Ngrx Store tutorial by Brian Troncone](https://gist.github.com/btroncone/a6e4347326749f938510), using Angular Cli version 1 with Angular 4.

Each step in the tutorial matches with a branch (or sometimes 2):
1. Setting Up The First Reducer: branch FirstReducer
2. Configuring Store Actions: branch configuring-store-actions
3. Utilizing Container Components: branch containers-components
4. Utilizing the AsyncPipe: branches withasyncpipe and asyncpipe part 2
5. intermezzo: branch devtools (installs and adds the configuration for Redux devtools, needs npm install)
6. changeDetection: branch changeDetectionOnPush
7. Expanding State: branch expandingState
8. Slicing State for Views: branch slicingStateForViews (remark: doesn't seem to work, will need fix)
9. Projecting State for View with combineLatest and withLatestFrom: branch projectingState (remark: filtering doesn't work)
10. bugfix on previous step to make the filtering work: branch projecting-bugfix
